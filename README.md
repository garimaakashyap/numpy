## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter/Colab notebook `g_numpy.ipynb` where I have learned the **fundamentals of NumPy**, the core library for numerical computing in Python. It covers array creation, operations, and important techniques used in data science and scientific computing.

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

In this notebook, I have learned:

- **Creating NumPy Arrays** using `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, and `np.arange()`
- **Array Indexing and Slicing** to access and modify elements
- **Array Operations** like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Broadcasting** to perform operations on arrays of different shapes
- **Statistical Functions** such as `np.mean()`, `np.median()`, `np.std()`, `np.sum()`
- **Linear Algebra** operations including dot products and matrix multiplication
- **Random Sampling** using `np.random`
- **Reshaping and Resizing** arrays with `np.reshape()` and `np.resize()`

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Libraries

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
